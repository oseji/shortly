# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
